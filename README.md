## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- vanilla javascript 

### What I learned

Using the 'data' attribute in HTML and to make the js code easier: 
```html
<span class="rating" data-rating="5">5</span>
```

I also learned that you need to break down a bit problem into smaller more specific problems that you than solve by their own instead of just giving up.


### Continued development
I want imporve my css transition skills and also get more used to manipulating the DOM with vanilla JavaScript.
